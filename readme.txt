    // Introduction ///////////////////////////////////////////
    
    razorCMS is an open source flat file Content Management System,
    this means there is no need to use an additional database, all
    data is stored in file format.
    
    razorCMS comes in one flavour, core. This is the base system which
    comes with only necessary functionality, just enough to be usefull
    while giving you enough tools to create a website. This means those
    wishing to keep the system fast and small may do so.
    
    Those wishing to have a more flexible easy to use system may then
    begin to add the functionality they wish by using the simple blade
    manager, adding blade packs to the system containing anything from
    sef url re-writes (search engine friendly URL's) to WYSIWYG html
    editors.
    
    This kind of approach to CMS solutions gives you a lego brick
    structure, using only the blade packs you wish to create a tailor
    made solution that fits your needs, without being bogged down with
    functionality you do not need. This should help to keep your
    CMS solution sharp and simple.

    // About razorCMS /////////////////////////////////////////

    razorCMS came about from some brief time spent using nanoCMS, this
    is an open source CMS solution created by Kalyan Chakravarthy. After
    forking the nanoCMS project to create uCMS, adding extra functionality,
    it was decided that more needed to be done.
    
    razorCMS was created from scratch, using a whole new design, but using
    some of the usefull parts of uCMS in a few places. All of the old
    uCMS code that has found its way into razorCMS has been re-written,
    but most of the code in razorCMS is new code. Version 1.0 of the system
    further distances itself from uCMS showing it to be a completely
    diferent system to uCMS and it's father nanoCMS.
    
    Due to this system using very small parts of code from uCMS, all of razorCMS
    is offered under the GPLv3 licence.
    
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    // Installing razorCMS /////////////////////////////////////

    1) Download and unpack razorCMS_core_v#_#.zip.

    2) Upload the install.php file and razorCMS_parcel.zip archive to your server
       using your ftp client or via your hosts file browser application.
       Please ensure you do not unzip the parcel file as this is automatically unpacked
       on installation.

    3) Set the permissions of your installation root (this is the folder your
       install files are placed in) to 0777 open permissions to allow write access
       to this folder so the installer can unpack and install razorCMS. This is only temporary
       and needs to be set back to 0755 or not publicly writable after install, failure to do
       so will leave your installation open to vulnerabilities. You will be prompted
       on the admin homepage if this is not carried out.
    
    4) Using your web browser, navigate to your install location, adding /install.php
       on to the end of the url in the address bar (e.g. www.yoursite.com/install.php).

    5) Follow the instructions on screen to install the system, please ensure that
       you make a note of the administration console username and password you choose,
       you will need to use this to gain access to the administration console to manage
       your new site.

    6) IMPORTANT : ENSURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE END OF THE INSTALL, failure to do so
       may make your site unusable and may leave it open to security issues. Ensure you
       follow ALL instructions on securing your install folder as this is not accessable
       by razorCMS due to standard server configuration.

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    // AddOn's ////////////////////////////////////////////////

    razorCMS uses a system called the blade manager to manage addons called blade packs.
    Blade packs offer a way to improve, add to or change the way the system looks
    or acts.

    To add a blade pack simply go to the main website, look through the blade packs
    section, download, and use the dedicated installer section in the blade manager.
    
    Any special requirements needed after the blade pack is installed will be notified
    on the installation screen, like setting up, use and special instructions.
