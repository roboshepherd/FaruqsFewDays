<h1>What's the Purpose of Our Life?</h1>
<h2><strong>Does the answer equals to the value of a human life?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>After failing to realize the correct answer of this question, many  	people suicide and put an end to their earthly life.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In spite of having a vast amount of worldly treasures, fames and  	fortunes, life becomes meaningless to many others.</li>
<li>Most people ask this question at some point of their life.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page presents the summary of my learning about the purpose of our few days  existence.</p>

<h1>My Analysis on this interview</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who Made You?</strong><br /> As we realize that the person, who made a certain thing, knows very well  	about its purpose. Therefore to identify our Creator and His motivation is  	clearly relevant to us.</li>
<li><strong>Where You Are Here?<br /> </strong>The most common response is &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;. But everything around us  	exists for a purpose, so do we live here.</li>
<li><strong>What is the value of knowing the answer just before death?</strong><br /> If one's father gives me a billion dollar (just for an example) to spend&nbsp;  	it within an hour according to his wish, what one shall do then? Will this  	boy agree to wait until last second loosing the whole opportunity? Yet we  	have so many organs valuing an unknown price leased for an unknown period of  	time. If we realize the real purpose of our life at the last minute before  	death, does it make any sense then?</li>
<li><strong>Yes, Big-bang does not answer the source of all energy and mass or  	the organizer of the series events. </strong> <br /> The way the universe is organized,  	the perfection, the balance, everything represents the complexity of its  	creation and a need of a creator. If our planet earth is little more closer  	than as it is now every living thing would die because of high heat. The  	slight increase or decrease of gravity force could invalidate our existence.</li>
<li><strong>Were we evolved from apes ?</strong><br /> The complex example of human eye as observed by scientists including Darwin  	says that there is no answer how all all sub-parts of eye, e.g., retina, iris,  	connections with brain etc. perfectly evolve to a coordinated system in  	exactly the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Big-Bang is the part of the design of the Creator. </strong><br /> Muslim belief has no conflict to acknowledge it that the concept of Big-bang  	or natural selection is under the design of our Creator. Every animal adapts  	over time according to its living environment.</li>
<li><strong>Why do we created for a purpose ?</strong><br /> If we, human being, make everything to serve us doesn't it make sense that  	our Creator also make us to serve Him?</li>
<li><strong>How to find that purpose?<br /> </strong>If something is simple in creation we can know its purpose by intuition  	or simple experiments, but if something is complex we should seek some  	authoritative documents from the creator. So God says in His divine book  	Al-Quran (that is intact for last 1500 years) " And I (All&acirc;h) created not  	the jinn (spirits) and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)".  	Worshiping is broadly understood as the actions that pleases God.</li>
<li><strong>What are the benefits of living life with a definite purpose?</strong><br /> Finding peace by submitting oneself fully to the God (Alone), the source of  	all Peace (As-Salaam).</li>
