<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Summary of research achievements <br /></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Shepherding Robots.</strong></span> Since 2007, I have been shepherding UK's one of the largest multi-robot teams which consists of more than 40 e-puck robots and state-of the-art network cluster and other hardware. Here I have specialized in multi-robot systems by developing bio-inspired control algorithms and software frameworks for multi-robot control, communication and position tracking. <br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Before that.</span></strong> During my Masters study at Korea Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KIST), I studied the mobile robotics, intelligent control, information security and several other courses at Korea University and conducted practical research on mobile robots at KIST's highly equipped research laboratories. I developed an intelligent security scheme and a real-time humanoid control system for the Korean humanoid robot named MAHRU.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">As an open-source developer. </span></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the infancy of Linux (1999),</span></span> I am an open-source developer. I have been awarded the prestigious <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/" target="_blank">Google's summer-of-code</a> open-source development sponsorship twice (in 2010 competition, acceptance rate is 18% out of 5,539 total applicants). In 2009, I worked for Bluez and successfully tested the feasibility of integrating short-range NFC communication with Linux Bluetooth stack. In 2010 competition, I was mentored by a cryptographic expert and successfully developed a decentralized introduction scheme for Tahoe-LAFS.</p>

<h1>Some more from my research log<br /></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>From network engineering to robot shepherding.</strong></span> During the early stage of my professional career as a network engineer, I developed an interest to study the networking and communication in large social systems. My PhD course gave me an excellent opportunity  to study the self-regulation in social systems in a collaborative environment. I studied the self-regulation of division of labour from three different social perspectives: biological, social and artificial systems. This has given me  the solid foundation to understand how the social networks in various systems are self-regulated and self-sustained with a group of relatively incapable individuals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Early days of robot tracking.</strong></span> During my Masters study, I developed the essential skills and gained valuable experiences by dealing with real-robot control system. That gave me confidence to manage a multi-robot system consists of more than 40 mobile robots. However, I had no background knowledge and skill to track them in real-time. So I spent about six-months to set-up a multi-robot tracking system by studying computer vision, coding and testing algorithms for blob detection and so forth. Finally I arrived at the memorable moment when my tracking system  was able to track 43 robots in real-time!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Division of labour to be in place.</strong></span> Then my research focus shifted to study the self-regulated division of labour among ants. As a part of our EPSRC research project, I worked with our collaborators of Imperial College London and University of the Wast of England to simulate the biological model of division of labour in NetLogo software. After observing the necessary capabilities of our model in simulation, we decided to write code  to drive real-robots questing for the self-regulated task-allocation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Amazing communication.</strong> </span>Before starting my robotic experiments, I thoroughly reviewed the various communication strategies observed in biological social systems. This knowledge influenced me a lot to set-up a set of multi-robot experiments for comparing centralized and local communication patterns similar to those of two groups of social wasps. We already had a model that could explain the self-regulated division of labour among ants. I interpreted this model for multi-robot systems and conducted experiments towards achieving self-regulated multi-robot task-allocation in a manufacturing shop-floor scenario.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">A lot of hard work!</span></strong> Driving real robots require a lot of hard work. Designing the software architecture, finding state-of-the-art tools and technologies, software coding, testing, running experiments, writing scripts for data analysis etc. were all done by myself with a great motivation and aspiration for new findings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>End of the Day</strong>.</span> Our results confirms the biological hypothesis that self-regulated task-allocation is done in a smaller group without any local communication. However, we also found that task-specialization can still be beneficial to the smaller groups of individuals. Our experimental evidences suggest that in relatively large group of individuals (approximately more than 10) local decentralized communication plays a great role for achieving an energy-efficient self-regulated task-allocation whereas centralized communication fails to do so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Some more...</strong></span> In relation to the self-regulated division of labour in social systems, we have arranged to analyse our experimental data in order to find  communication patterns that can suggest network clusters based on local communications among robots. Wait for new findings!</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Future plans</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Passion for self-organizing rescue robots!</span></strong> Now I am interested to apply the theory of self-regulation in emergency search and rescue works. Isn't it very amazing to  see that a trapped animal is rescued by its peers, immediately after it falls into a danger? I asked myself this question how the group of animals can mobilize themselves so fast, whereas human rescue-workers often can not do that. So far I understand, the self-regulated behaviours, the sense of care for the group and the timely use of  appropriate communication strategies enable animals to respond to an emergency situation in such an efficient manner. I believe that these self-regulated strategies can be implemented in a multi-robot search and rescue team which can autonomously re-allocate themselves in appropriate disaster site based on the cues from human rescue workers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Living in distributed networks</span><span style="color: #ff6600;">.</span> </strong>As a part of my extra-curricular activities, I took part in Google summer of code 2010 competition (a leading open-source programming contest). I was awarded an sponsorship to work with Tahoe-LAFS (a distributed P2P file system). My assignment was to design an algorithm that could enable Tahoe-LAFS's peer-to-peer nodes from a decentralized publish/subscribe introduction scheme. The idea of self-regulated social system can also be applied to computing nodes  that are required to save energy and communicate efficiently. I am also interested to investigate the self-organized approaches  to address the scalability issue of a large distributed networks.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">More with social networks. </span></strong>My future research interest also includes finding the role of an established hierarchy or authority to the individual's communication patterns that are common in honey-bee colonies, such as, in presence of a queen. Traditionally, human organizations have been heavily relied upon their centralized communication structures. But biological studies suggest that the division of labour emerges from the informal communication patterns among individuals. I hope my research findings will help corporations and institutions to design better organization where an established hierarchy should not prevent, but rather encourage, the emergence of new informal groups and activities in order to achieve self-regulation and self-sustenance.</p>
