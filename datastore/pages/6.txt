<h2>Research on self-regulated robot society</h2>
<p>I am researching towards developing a self-regulated robot society similar to the ant colony, human society or any other biological society. In a collaborative EPSRC project, we are trying to find a set of generic rules that seed the emergence of division of labour in those societies. Inspired by the observation of division of labour in an ant colony, we have proposed a model of division of labour called Attractive Field Model (AFM). In our lab we are implementing this model into a society of small e-puck robots.</p>
<h3>Areas of my research</h3>
<p>My current research is primarily interconnected with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-robot systems </strong> (e.g., Swarm Robotics)</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed AI </strong>(e.g., Decentralized multi-agent systems)</li>
    <li><strong>Computer Vision </strong>(Tracking robots in real-time) and</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Systems </strong>(Implementing different  communication strategies for robots).</li>
</ul>
<!--
<h3>Areas of my work</h3>
<p>My current research focuses on three major aspects of this implementation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Putting Attractive Field Model on e-puck robot's controller,
    </li>
    <li>Tracking and logging these robot's movement in real-time and
    </li>
    <li>Implementing different  communication strategies for these robots.
    </li>
</ol>
